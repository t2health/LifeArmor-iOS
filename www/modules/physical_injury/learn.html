					<h3>Physical Injuries And Deployment</h3>
					<p>During deployment you may have suffered a serious physical
						injury. Your physical injury may have caused disfigurement,
						serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the
						function of any bodily organ. Coping with the aftermath of a
						physical injury can be challenging for you and your loved ones.
						It&apos;s important to remember to be patient with yourself.
						Experiencing a wide range of emotions is a natural and important
						part of the healing process. The way you adapt to your injury will
						be influenced by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your personality.</li>
						<li>Your life experiences.</li>
						<li>Your health before the injury.</li>
						<li>Support from your family and friends.</li>
						<li>The meaning you assign to the event that caused your
							injury.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Importance Of Acceptance</h3>
					<p>While coping with an injury is a personal process, some
						aspects of healing after a deployment-related injury are common
						for everyone. For example, accepting a serious injury means
						dealing with loss. This loss can include: body parts or functions;
						the loss of physical capabilities and skills; the loss of a former
						identity; the loss of mobility; and perhaps the loss of your
						future plans.</p>
					<p>The length of your grieving process largely depends on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your personality.</li>
						<li>Your life experiences.</li>
						<li>Your health before the injury.</li>
						<li>Support from your family and friends.</li>
						<li>The meaning you assign to the event that caused your
							injury.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Keep in mind that everyone has a different recovery
						timeframe. Taking longer to reach the acceptance period than
						someone else doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re weak.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Seven Suggestions On Adjusting To Your Injury</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Focus on what you still have and what you can still do.</li>
						<li>Nurture your sense of humor. Be prepared for stares and
							insensitive comments.</li>
						<li>Set goals for yourself. Take it one day at a time or even
							one hour at a time.</li>
						<li>Seek balance. Don&apos;t isolate yourself and make time
							to work, rest, and play.</li>
						<li>Do not let others dictate your mood or actions.</li>
						<li>Be assertive.</li>
						<li>Never give up. Each day may pose a new challenge and you
							may struggle but as long as you are alive anything is possible.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>At some point in the various journeys we embark on in our
						lives, we get to a part where we feel like giving up. Sometimes we
						give up before we even start and other times we give up just
						before we are about to make it over that hurdle. Keep in mind you
						have the power to choose how you want to see yourself and your
						situation. You have the power to think positively, negatively, or
						realistically. You choose your mood, attitude, and feelings. You
						control your own thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Your Treatment Team</h3>
					<p>Beating the challenges posed by your injuries takes
						attitude, determination, and practice. You&apos;ll need to rely on
						strengths you&apos;ve learned in the past and incorporate new
						strategies. Sports teams need a coach to teach new skills, monitor
						progress, and encourage development. You can benefit from the help
						of a coach, too. Your &quot;coach&quot; is called a therapist. In
						fact, you may have a whole roster of therapists/coaches aside from
						your medical providers:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A <b><i>physical therapist</i>
						</b> assists with proper movement and healing to improve physical
							performance.</li>
						<li>An <b><i>occupational therapist</i>
						</b> helps you adjust and make changes so that you are able to manage
							your daily needs yourself.</li>
						<li>A <b><i>mental health therapist</i>
						</b> will help you make adjustments to changes in your life.</li>
						<li>A <b><i>spiritual therapist</i>
						</b> is someone of your faith or belief who can help you understand
							any conflicts between your beliefs and your experiences.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Accept help, but realize that, ultimately, it&apos;s <b><i>your</i>
						</b> attitude, practice, and performance that will determine how
						things turn out.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Change Your Self-Image</h3>
					<p>If your deployment injuries left you disabled or disfigured,
						you might compare yourself to people around you. You may compare
						the way you look and function now to the way you looked and
						functioned before your injury. These comparisons are normal and
						natural. But, in order to recover and thrive, you need to develop
						a new self-image apart from those comparisons. Developing a
						positive self-image after an injury may take a while, so be
						patient and focus on the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Give up your old, pre-injury self-image.</b> As a
							service member trained to stay in shape, you may base your
							self-esteem on your physical appearance and abilities. Your
							physical self is just one aspect of your total self. These two
							exercises can help you keep your physical appearance and
							abilities in perspective.
							<ul>
								<li><i>Accept your new body (including a prosthetic if
										you have an amputation).</i> To fully recover, you need to
									visualize and accept your appearance with the injury.</li>
								<li><i>Combat the stereotypes of &quot;physical
										perfection.&quot;</i> When you show no self-consciousness in front
									of others, you educate others and help them overcome our
									culture&apos;s misguided emphasis on &quot;physical
									perfection.&quot;</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Make sense of your injury.</b> One of the toughest
							jobs related to adjusting to war injuries is to make sense out of
							the injury and why it happened. Service members who find positive
							meaning in their sacrifice and fit their injury into their world
							view have a greater sense of well-being and less anxiety and
							depression.
							<ul>
								<li><i>Search for a positive direction that you could
										pursue because of your injury.</i> Have you learned to appreciate
									small things you used to take for granted? Have you formed new
									relationships or grown closer to loved ones? Has the injury
									increased your wisdom or faith? Have you learned new skills you
									didn&apos;t have before? Are you stronger and more resilient
									than you ever thought you could be?</li>
								<li><i>Look to your faith to help you find meaning.</i>
								</li>
								<li><i>Find a new purpose for your life in light of
										your injury.</i> This might be an immediate purpose, like turning
									an ordinary event into something special and significant. Or it
									might be a long-term purpose, like helping other injured people
									get their lives back on track.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Set Goals For The Future.</b> Once you accept and make
							sense of your injury, you can start to see your life in terms of
							possibilities, instead of limitations. Begin to set goals for the
							future. Goal-setting is important for both your physical recovery
							and for positive mental health. Setting goals will give you a
							sense of purpose and help you focus on your future. Here are some
							steps to goal-setting that will help you plan for a positive
							future:
							<ul>
								<li>Write out your goal: &quot;My goal is to ...&quot;</li>
								<li>Make sure the goal is yours, not someone else&apos;s.
									Don&apos;t set goals based on what you think society expects
									you to do.</li>
								<li>Make your goal as specific as possible. For example,
									&quot;my goal is to start hiking again,&quot; is too general.
									Be specific: &quot;My goal is to climb Mt. Whitney.&quot;</li>
								<li>Write down all the intermediate steps required to
									accomplish your goal.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Handle Unwanted Attention.</b> Visible injuries, burns
							and amputations, attract more attention and wheelchairs will also
							indicate an injury or disability. Here are some tips for coping
							with common challenges.
							<ul>
								<li>When someone stares, accept it as part of human nature.
									People naturally pay attention to anything out of the ordinary,
									so your injuries may draw attention. People will stare out of
									curiosity, compassion, or concern - not rudeness. You may not
									be able to control their staring but you can control your
									reaction. Don&apos;t allow other people&apos;s reactions to
									prevent you from living a good life.</li>
								<li>When someone is curious about your injury have an
									answer ready. This will reduce any embarrassment or anger you
									might feel. Rehearse your response until it feels natural and
									friendly (not hostile). If someone asks for more information
									and you don&apos;t feel like talking about it, have a response
									ready for that, too: &quot;That&apos;s all I care to say about
									it today. I&apos;m sure you understand.&quot;</li>
								<li>When someone makes fun of your injury you may feel the
									urge to get revenge or defend yourself. But either response
									will fuel the other person&apos;s wishes. Instead, your
									response should: stop the other person from harassing you, and
									maintain your self-respect. Ignore put downs, or if you feel
									the need to respond to an insult, use humor to diffuse the
									situation.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Be Confident And Friendly.</b> Whenever you are out in
							public or enter a new social situation, you can influence the way
							people respond to you by projecting confidence. When people see
							you are self-assured and friendly, they will focus on your
							personality instead of your injuries. Use <b><i>The STEPS
									tool</i>
						</b> to accomplish this. Practice the following steps until they
							become natural and automatic.
							<ul>
								<li><b>S = <i>Self-talk</i>
								</b> (make it positive) - &quot;I accept myself and I&apos;m
									comfortable with other people.&quot;</li>
								<li><b>T = <i>Tone of voice</i>
								</b> - friendly, warm, enthusiastic.</li>
								<li><b>E = <i>Eye contact</i>
								</b> - look people in the eye.</li>
								<li><b>P = <i>Posture</i>
								</b> - head raised, shoulders back.</li>
								<li><b>S = <i>Smile</i>
								</b> - confident but approachable.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Ask For Help.</b> There may be times when you need
							help. It&apos;s important to ask for help in a direct manner so
							people can figure out what you need. Direct requests have three
							parts.
							<ul>
								<li>State your needs: <i>&quot;I need to get to the
										doctor&apos;s office tomorrow.&quot;</i>
								</li>
								<li>Make the request: <i>&quot;Would you be able to
										drive me?&quot;</i>
								</li>
								<li>Acknowledge the other person&apos;s response: <i>&quot;Thank
										you, I really appreciate it.&quot;</i> <b>Exercise:</b> Make a
									list of areas where you need help. Then write a script with a
									direct request for each item, using the three-part request
									approach listed above. Finally, practice each request until it
									becomes automatic. The next time you ask for help, you&apos;ll
									be able to ask in a direct, confident, and open manner.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Develop New Relationships.</b> Relationships keep you
							from becoming withdrawn or isolated. Friends, family and
							coworkers can sustain you through your physical recovery. Their
							support will make your daily triumphs more meaningful. You may
							meet new friends in the hospital, at support groups, and in
							recreational or community activities so as you build new,
							remember:
							<ul>
								<li>Be a good listener. Instead of planning what to say
									while the other person is speaking, listen carefully. Every
									once in a while, repeat what they&apos;re saying in your own
									words. Use phrases like &quot;What I hear you saying is…&quot;,
									or &quot;You seem to be saying…Is that right?&quot; This helps
									the other person feel understood.</li>
								<li>Ask questions that show you are interested in the whole
									person, not just their work or their deployment experience.
									Everyone has a unique personal story to tell if you act
									interested. If you follow these guidelines, people will know
									you are comfortable with your injury and interested in getting
									to know them.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Returning To Work After An Injury</h3>
					<p>Finding or returning to employment is one of the most
						important aspects of adjusting to an injury. Employment will
						increase your self-esteem, personal independence, and financial
						security. Ask yourself these questions when looking for
						employment.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Are you capable of returning to the job you formerly
							held? If not, are you able to work in a similar position where
							your expertise can be valuable?</li>
						<li>Would you prefer to work in a different field from your
							former employment? If so, what training or education will you
							need? Is it realistic to pursue this training or education?</li>
						<li>Does the new job have advancement potential? Does it
							offer training? Is there room for growth?</li>
						<li>Are you interested in this field? Or is this &quot;just a
							job&quot;?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						You will perform better and find more satisfaction in a job that
						really &quot;calls&quot; to you. People with disabilities cannot
						be denied employment just because they&apos;re disabled if they
						are able to perform the essential duties of the position. For more
						information on employment and disability, visit the U.S.

					<h3>Get Involved In Your Community</h3>
					<p>Through your service to your country, you gained life
						experience. One way of sharing that experience with others is by
						working or volunteering in your community</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Attend town meetings and... Vote.</i>
						</b> Most communities hold open public meetings at least once a year.
							These meetings are excellent places to learn about the issues and
							allow you to voice your concerns. Vote in all local and national
							elections. Contact your local town hall for registration and
							voting information.</li>
						<li><b><i>Volunteer your skills.</i>
						</b> There are many organizations that could use your skills and
							assistance, to find volunteer opportunities in your area, check
							out Volunteer Match at <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org"
							target="_blank">http://www.volunteermatch.org</a>.</li>
						<li><b><i>Be a mentor.</i>
						</b> Mentoring is a great way to impact a child&apos;s life. Consider
							becoming a Big Brother or Big Sister. To find out more, visit <a
							href="http://www.bigbrothersbigsisters.org" target="_blank">
								http://www.bigbrothersbigsisters.org</a>.</li>
						<li><b><i>Participate in a sports activity.</i>
						</b> Check with your community recreation department to find sporting
							activities and youth leagues in your area. Or consider coaching
							or being an assistant coach to a local team.</li>
						<li><b><i>Get involved with your child&apos;s school.</i>
						</b> If you have children, join the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
							This is an excellent way to learn more about your child&apos;s
							school activities.</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Find Recreational Activities</h3>
					<p>Physical activity reduces stress, increases muscle and
						cardiovascular tone, and may increase the release of endorphins -
						the brain&apos;s natural pain killers. Thanks to modern
						advancements in prosthetics, mechanical aides, specialized sports
						equipment, and access laws, recreational options are ever evolving
						and limitless. Recreational activities also enhance
						self-confidence, increase independent functioning, and develop
						strength and endurance. If you&apos;re looking for a new
						adventure, try one of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Get in touch with the great outdoors. Try fishing,
							mountain climbing, white water rafting, horseback riding,
							canoeing or kayaking, snowshoe, snowboarding or skiing.</li>
						<li>Try a new intramural sport offered at your local
							recreational center. Some activities offered can include ballroom
							dancing classes, softball, basketball, soccer, kickball, dodge
							ball, tennis, or join a swim team or try your hand at golf.</li>
						<li>If you prefer cold weather, look for local ski or
							snowboard trips. You may also enjoy snowmobiling, snowshoeing,
							cross country skiing, ice skating or sledding.</li>
						<li>If you&apos;re seeking a bit of an adrenaline rush you
							can always try paragliding, skydiving or maybe enjoy a hot air
							balloon ride.</li>

					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Medications</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Narcotics:</b> Also known as opioid based drugs,
							morphine, oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl are used for acute
							pain, such as pain after an amputation or burn surgery. Also,
							these narcotics are often used for chronic pain in low doses if
							other methods are not effective but keep in mind they are habit
							forming and should be used as prescribed by a medical
							professional.</li>
						<li><b>Anti-inflammatory Drugs:</b> Aspirin and non-steroidal
							anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (advil and
							motrin) and naproxen (aleve) reduce swelling, irritation and
							pain. When treating more serious inflammatory conditions one can
							be prescribed steroidal drugs like cortisone or prednisone.</li>
						<li><b>Antidepressants:</b> Newer medications (like Cymbalta)
							are used for chronic pain or pain due to nerve damage or an
							amputation. Antidepressants may also induce restful sleep.</li>
						<li><b>Anti-seizure Medications:</b> May relieve what some
							patients describe as &quot;shooting&quot; or &quot;burning&quot;
							pain caused by damaged nerves and aching pain. Additionally,
							these medications are used for chronic pain.</li>
						<li><b>Injections:</b> Local anesthetics (such as Novocain)
							can be injected around nerve roots and directly into muscles or
							joints. Injections reduce swelling, muscle spasms and abnormal
							nerve activity.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Hot And Cold Compresses</h3>
					<p>When seeking pain relief through hot and cold compresses it
						can be beneficial to experiment and see which treatment works best
						for you. (Follow your health care provider&apos;s directions on
						how long to apply each.)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Heat Compresses:
							<ul>
								<li>Heat above 104F blocks the body&apos;s ability to
									detect pain.</li>
								<li>An electric heating pad or hot water bottle applied to
									the site of the pain may give relief and will reduce the joint
									and muscle stiffness.</li>
								<li>Heat increases the blood flow to the injured area,
									bringing nutrients to damaged tissues.</li>
								<li><b>NOTE:</b> Heat should not be applied immediately
									after an injury.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Cold Compresses:
							<ul>
								<li>Relieves pain by numbing the affected area.</li>
								<li>Reduces swelling and inflammation.</li>
								<li>Reduces bleeding.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Acupuncture/Acupressure/Massage</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Acupuncture:</b> Is an alternative medicine that
							treats patients by insertion and manipulation of needles into the
							body. Acupuncture is approved by the National Institutes of
							Health for the treatment of chronic pain and may help with
							&quot;phantom&quot; limb pain.</li>
						<li><b>Acupressure:</b> Is also an alternative medicine that
							involves placing physical pressure by hand, elbow, or with the
							aid of various devices, on different pressure points on the
							surface of the body to bring about relief through greater balance
							and circulation of fluids.</li>
						<li><b>Massage:</b> Is the manipulation of superficial and
							deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue to enhance
							function, aid in the healing process and promote relaxation and
							well-being. Therapeutic massage may disrupt the transmission of
							pain signals to the brain and stimulate the release of the
							body&apos;s natural painkillers (endorphins).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Electrical Stimulation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
								(TENS):</b> A low-voltage electrical current is transmitted through
							electrodes that are taped to the skin near the pain. The electric
							current may prevent pain signals from reaching the brain. It can
							be effective with many types of pain, particularly phantom limb
							pain.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Hypnosis</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Hypnotherapy:</b> Modern hypnotherapy can leave a
							person in a deep relaxation and leaves the mind open to
							suggestions of pain relief. Approved by the National Institutes
							of Health as a pain control method, hypnotherapy may be useful in
							reducing both acute and chronic pain and anxiety associated with
							painful procedures (i.e., burn treatments).</li>
						<li><b>Autohypnosis:</b> Is a self-induced hypnosis (or deep
							relaxation) and can be used to create a state of relaxation or
							distraction from pain.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Managing Your Pain With Stress Reduction Techniques</h3>
					<p>Stress intensifies both chronic and acute pain. One way to
						manage your stress and potentially reduce your pain can be
						practicing deep breathing exercises (check out Breath2Relax, a
						mobile application for your iPhone or iPad, provides simple
						instructions for performing breathing exercises proven to decrease
						the body&apos;s stress response). Another technique is progressive
						muscle relaxation. This exercise involves tensing and relaxing
						muscle groups throughout the body and releasing the muscle tension
						associated with increased pain.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Avoid The Following When Managing Your Pain</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Don&apos;t self-medicate the pain by overusing alcohol or
							abusing drugs.</li>
						<li>Don&apos;t try to &quot;tough out&quot; the pain. Pain is
							treatable.</li>
						<li>Let your doctor know if you have new or constant pain. Be
							open to trying different treatments or combinations of treatments
							until you find what works for you.</li>
						<li>Don&apos;t use tobacco products if you have a spinal
							injury. Tobacco can lead to degenerative disk disease, which
							causes back and leg pain.</li>
