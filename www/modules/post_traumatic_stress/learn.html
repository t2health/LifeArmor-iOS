					<h3>What is PTSD?</h3>
					<p>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety
						disorder. PTSD is caused by experiencing traumatic events, such as
						combat, disasters, terrorism, serious accidents, or physical or
						sexual assault.</p>
					<p>PTSD includes 3 types of symptoms:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Re-experiencing or Reliving the Trauma:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Intrusive memories or flashbacks that can seem real</li>
								<li>Nightmares</li>
								<li>Feeling upset by trauma reminders</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Avoidance and Numbing:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Avoiding places or people that are reminders of the
									trauma</li>
								<li>Isolating from others</li>
								<li>Feeling numb or empty</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>Increased Arousal:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Feeling on guard</li>
								<li>Being irritable</li>
								<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
								<li>Startling easily</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
					These symptoms may lead to problems in functioning in a number of
					settings, including social and family life, work, and school.

					<h3>Understanding Trauma Memories</h3>
					Traumatic events may be difficult to fit into what is considered
					normal experience. The mind may &quot;replay&quot; the experience
					during the day and during sleep (dreaming) in an attempt to manage
					the &quot;shock&quot; to the system caused by the trauma. However,
					obtaining meaning and a sense of control over upsetting thoughts
					can prove difficult.
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Are Trauma Triggers?</h3>
					<p>While unwanted thoughts or memories seem to occur &quot;out
						of the blue,&quot; such thoughts are usually triggered by an event
						that serves as a reminder of the trauma.</p>
					<p>Reminders of triggers include sights, sounds, smells, body
						sensations, and internal experiences (thoughts, memories,
						feelings).</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Is The Impact Of Trauma Triggers?</h3>
					<p>It is common for the mind to link trauma events with
						subsequent day-to-day living. For example, in a combat situation a
						Marine who was ambushed while driving under a bridge may be
						&quot;on guard&quot; back home when approaching a highway
						overpass. While there is no actual threat back home, the mind has
						learned to link bridges with danger. Back home, bridges come to
						&quot;trigger&quot; fear or tension, or a keyed-up reaction.</p>
					<p>When the mind &quot;pairs&quot; highway bridges with danger
						in a combat environment, the mind is correctly adapting to
						circumstances. When approaching an overpass in a combat setting,
						the warfighter should be keyed up and ready for danger. Back home,
						this &quot;overlearned&quot; response, adaptive in one setting, is
						no longer helpful. Unfortunately, being triggered by harmless
						situations also creates stress for the mind and body.</p>
					<p>Triggers have another unfortunate result - individuals begin
						to avoid the things or places or people that remind them of the
						trauma. In the above example, the Marine goes out of his way to
						avoid highway overpasses. Such avoidance has additional costs by
						adding additional time to travel and by potentially causing social
						embarrassment when explaining to passengers the reason for
						detouring around overpasses.</p>
					<p>Back home, the mind must &quot;re-learn&quot; that highway
						bridges are a common and safe means to travel from one location to
						another. In other words, the mind must &quot;disconnect&quot;
						now-useless reminders from the brain&apos;s danger circuits by
						recognizing trauma triggers and responding to them in new ways.</p>

					<h3>Identifying Your Trauma Triggers</h3>
					<p>Some trauma triggers are easy to identify because they
						clearly remind you of the trauma. Other triggers may be less easy
						to recognize. Learning to identify your triggers has benefits:
						you&apos;ll feel more in control, and you&apos;ll be better
						prepared to face future situations.</p>
					<p>Maintaining a &quot;Trigger Record&quot; is a great way to
						identify triggers (especially the ones that are less obvious). A
						Trigger Record will help you recognize your triggers, and allow
						you to monitor your improved reactions to those triggers.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Trigger Record</h3>
					<p>You can find printable trigger records in
						afterdeployment.org&apos;s Post-Traumatic Stress library. Or, you
						can simply write down your observations whenever you have
						experienced a trauma trigger:</p>
					<p>
						First, record the date and time.<br> <i>Example: Monday,
							2 p.m.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Second, describe the trigger.<br> <i>Example: Driving
							under an overpass.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Identify the emotions you were feeling.<br> <i>Example:
							Fear and worry.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Identify your body&apos;s reactions.<br> <i>Example:
							Started sweating and felt nauseous.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Record your thoughts and what you were telling yourself.<br>
						<i>Example: I&apos;m in danger. The overpass might blow up.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Identify the ways that the trigger differed from the original
						trauma<br> <i>Example: I&apos;m home, not in a combat
							situation.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						On a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being minimal and 10 being extreme,
						rate the amount of difficulty you had managing the trigger.<br>
						<i>Example: 7.</i>
					</p>
					<p>Use the Trigger Record as soon as possible each time you are
						triggered. If you aren&apos;t sure what triggered you, start by
						describing your thoughts, or your feelings or some sensation that
						you are having, and what you remember about the situation. Then,
						work backwards to determine the trigger that set you off.</p>

					<h3>The RID Tool</h3>
					<p>The RID Tool is a three-step skill. Use it when you are
						triggered to help &quot;RID&quot; yourself of reactions to
						triggers.
					<p>
						<b>STEP 1: R</b>elax<br> <b>STEP 2: I</b>dentify the Trigger<br>

						<b>STEP 3: D</b>ecide Your Response<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Step 1: Relax. Here are some ways to relax when you have
							been triggered:
							<ul>
								<li>Take a few deep breaths.</li>
								<li>Tell yourself something calming: &quot;I&apos;m not in
									danger now.&quot; &quot;The trauma is not happening
									again.&quot;</li>
								<li>Get a drink of water or walk to the restroom and splash
									cool water on your face.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Step 2: Identify the Trigger. Once you are relaxed, try
							identifying what factors may have caused the trigger.
							<ul>
								<li>Ask yourself, &quot;What is triggering me?&quot;
									&quot;How is this situation like the actual trauma trigger? By
									recognizing that the current trigger is different from the
									actual trauma, you&apos;ll begin to see that you are not in
									danger.
								<li>If you can&apos;t identify the trigger, don&apos;t
									worry. Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Step 3: Decide Your Response. Deciding how to respond to
							a situation can help you feel more in control. Try these
							suggestions:
							<ul>
								<li>Go back to what you were doing before the trigger.</li>
								<li>Start a conversation with someone around you.</li>
								<li>Seek support from someone you trust.</li>
								<li>Focus on sights and sounds around you.</li>
								<li>Find a positive distraction that will hold your
									attention.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>RID Tool: Deciding to Stay in the Trigger Situation</h3>
					<span class="underlined_text">Triggers And Fear:</span>
					<p>If your trigger makes you feel fearful or anxious, your
						first impulse may be to leave the situation. Don&apos;t give in to
						the impulse to take flight or avoid; instead, stay in the
						situation and face your fear. Don&apos;t leave the situation until
						you feel the trigger is less powerful than when you first
						confronted it.</p>
					<p>If you run from the trigger, you won&apos;t learn that the
						trigger is not dangerous. Avoiding your triggers may ease your
						anxiety in the short term, but will create bad habits and make
						overcoming the trigger&apos;s hold on you more and more difficult.
						Gradually, &apos;staring down&apos; a trigger will weaken it; the
						trigger will hold less power over you, and you will feel less
						distress in the presence of it.</p>
					<span class="underlined_text">Triggers And Anger:</span>
					<p>If the trigger makes you angry and you believe staying in
						the situation may cause you to act in a way you&apos;ll regret,
						remove yourself from the situation and cool off. Try some
						relaxation tools; or find someone you trust and talk things out.</p>

					<h3>What To Do After A Trigger Event Is Over</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Don&apos;t judge or criticize yourself harshly about how
							you handled the trigger.</li>
						<li>Treat yourself like a loved one or a close friend who
							might be going through the same thing.</li>
						<li>Regardless of outcome, see the trigger as a learning
							experience.
						<li>Complete a trigger record, and review what went well and
							how to improve your responses to the trigger.
						<li>Talk about the trigger event with a close friend or loved
							one.
						<li>Remind yourself that, with time and practice, triggers
							get easier to handle.
						<li>Reward yourself for successfully managing your trigger.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The PLAN Tool</h3>
					Here&apos;s a simple strategy to PLAN for encountering triggers or
					other stressful situations:
					<ul>
						<li><b>STEP 1: Prepare for the situation.</b> Think about
							ways to manage the situation. Discuss the situation with someone
							whose judgment you respect. Ask yourself:
							<ul>
								<li>Can I relax before the situation?</li>
								<li>Would it help to take along a friend who knows what I
									might experience?</li>
								<li>Can I change the situation, or make a plan to make it
									easier to deal with?</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>STEP 2: Let go of your worry.</b> Worrying how you
							will react to a situation can be worse than the actual situation
							that&apos;s causing the worry! To let go of your worry:
							<ul>
								<li>Ask yourself, &quot;What exactly am I worried
									about?&quot;</li>
								<li>Ask yourself, &quot;Are my fears reasonable?&quot;</li>
								<li>Rehearse ways to successfully manage the situation in
									your mind.</li>
								<li>Tell yourself, &quot;I&apos;ve prepared for the
									situation and that&apos;s the best I can do.&quot;</li>
								<li>If you start to worry, focus on a positive thought or
									activity.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>STEP 3: Accept that you may experience distress
								but that you can manage your reaction.</b> Even normal stress can
							become more difficult to manage after a trauma. Accepting that
							you will experience negative feelings can help you because:
							<ul>
								<li>While accepting does not mean feeling good about being
									upset, it does mean that you have realistic expectations about
									your reactions.</li>
								<li>It can help you to cope with situations better.</li>
								<li>You won&apos;t allow negative feelings to control your
									life.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><b>STEP 4: Note all of your coping skills and helpful
								resources.</b> Think of all the skills you have learned for managing
							stressful situations. Remind yourself: &quot;During stressful
							situations, I can…&quot;
							<ul>
								<li>Have a friend or loved one with me.</li>
								<li>Practice relaxation exercises.</li>
								<li>Say positive things to myself.</li>
								<li>Use positive strategies that worked on my triggers in
									the past.</li>
							</ul></li>
